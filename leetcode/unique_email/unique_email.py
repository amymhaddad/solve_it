# Create a list of strings split on "@", so I have a list that contains the name and domain name ["alice", "leetcode.com"]
# create an empty dictionary to hold all unique email addresses

# Validate the name
# Check to see if name is in the dictionary. If not, join the strings together on teh "," with "@" and add it to the dictionary
# Otherwise, I need validate the name
# Check if there are "." If so remove them  --> use regex
# Check if there are "+" If so extract the name up to the "+"
# Save the parsed name as a variable

# Now see if the parsed name is a value in the dictionary via this syntax:
# if dictionary[name] -- or use setfault
# If parsed name is not in the dictioanry, add it

# Return the length of the dictionary
